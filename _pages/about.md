I am a [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) Ph.D. candidate at [Yair Weiss'](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/) lab for computer vision.

I'm currenctly researching generative models in computer vision, specifically how (and if) they can be used for tasks other than generating data. Currently I am also the TA for HUJI's course for Bayesian Machine Learning, which Yair Weiss and I have built together.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
